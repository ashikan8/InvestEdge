A live portfolio optimizer that blends real market data with Modern Portfolio Theory to suggest risk-aware, upside-focused allocations through an interactive web app.

InvestEdge is a web-based portfolio optimization tool that helps users build smarter, data-driven investment allocations. Powered by Python (Flask, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn) and Yahoo Finance APIs, the app pulls live market data, computes stabilized expected returns (via exponentially weighted means blended with SPY), and optimizes weights using a Max-Sharpe framework that only excludes assets with negative expected contribution. The backend also runs backtests, risk metrics, and integer share allocation logic, while the frontend (HTML, CSS, and Chart.js) provides a clean, interactive interface. InvestEdge is designed for educational use, letting students and investors experiment with portfolio theory and see how allocation, risk, and upside potential interact in real time.
